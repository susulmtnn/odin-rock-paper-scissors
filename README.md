This is an exercise which is part of the Odin Project

I used Javascript to write a rock-paper-scissors game.

The game asks player to choose either rock, paper or scissors.

If you type something else you get an error message, but for fun it also means you lost.

After each round, you will know whether you won or lost the round in question.

The game consists of 5 rounds and at the end you will know if you won or lost to the computer.

The computer randomly chooses its turns.
